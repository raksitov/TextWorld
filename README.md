# First TextWorld Problems

The code for Stanford's CS230 (["Deep learning"](https://cs230.stanford.edu/)) final
project. In this project I am building a reinforcement learning agent for playing
text-based games in the TextWorld framework.

I explored various architectures for playing text-based games in the TextWorld framework.
I have started with the architectures available in the literature (LSTM-DQN [[1]](
https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08941), DRRN [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04636) and
SSAQN [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01999)) and proceeded to combine them into the
hybrid model, that successfully solves many games from the First TextWorld Problems
competition.
